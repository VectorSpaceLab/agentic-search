## Introduction

We propose **Retro\* (Retro-Star)**, a novel approach for reasoning-intensive document retrieval. Retro\* introduces a **rubric-based relevance scoring** mechanism, enabling the model to reason about the relationship between a task and a document based on explicitly defined criteria, whereby producing a fine-grained, interpretable relevance score. Retro\* also supports **test time scaling** by combining multiple reasoning trajectories via score integration, which produces more reliable relevance estimates.

To optimize Retro\*'s reasoning capabilities, we introduce a novel **reinforcement learning** algorithm tailored for its relevance scoring mechanism, which employs two composite rewards to fully exploit the trajectories of each training sample.

For more details, please refer to our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.24869).
